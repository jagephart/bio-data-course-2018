## 1) SPECIES RICHNESS WITH N-DEPOSITION 
Check out  http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/experiments/e001

#### i)  What did Clark and Tilman 2008 find? See text and Figure 1  
Q: What pattern did they observe between species richness and nitrogen treatment?  
Q: What years and treatments did they include in Figure 1?  


###WORKFLOW: Mimic Figure 1 (except on the y-axis just plot species richness).
Metadata here: http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/data/dataset?ple001  

#### ii) With a partner, write out the workflow you will use in English and put up a green sticky when done.
**Data QAQC**


**Data manipulation**


#### iii) After we have discussed as a class, write out and run the workflow in tidyverse R.
Here's the data import to get you going:
```{r}
# load the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# create a function to calculate standard error
calcSE<-function(x){
  x <- x[is.na(x)==F]
  sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))
}

# read in the data 
cdrplant <- read.csv("e001_Plant aboveground biomass data.csv", stringsAsFactors = F, skip = 726) %>%
  as_tibble()
```
