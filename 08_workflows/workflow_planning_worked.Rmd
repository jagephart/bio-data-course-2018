## 1) SPECIES RICHNESS WITH N-DEPOSITION 
Check out  http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/experiments/e001

#### i)  What did Clark and Tilman 2008 find? See text and Figure 1  
Q: What pattern did they observe between species richness and nitrogen treatment?  
Q: What years and treatments did they include in Figure 1?  


###WORKFLOW: Mimic Figure 1 (except on the y-axis just plot species richness).
Metadata here: http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/data/dataset?ple001  

#### ii) With a partner, write out the workflow you will use in English and put up a green sticky when done.
**Data QAQC**
To clean the data, I will first remove any biomass values that are NA or are less than or equal to zero.
Second, I will remove any species entries that are not species (e.g., miscellaneous categories, etc). To identify these values I will look at the unique species values, and then filter out the entries that do not correspond to actual species.
Third, to make sure that species are not double counted I will only retain unique values for each field/plot/year/treatment/species combination. To do this I will remove the biomass column and retain unique entries. 

**Data manipulation**
I will calculate species richness within each field/plot/year/treatment combination. I will group the data by field, plot, year, and treatment and count the number of rows within each group to measure species richness.
Second, I will calculate the mean and std error of richness within each treatment and year.
Third, I will filter the data to only retain the first 25 years (following Clark and Tilman 2008), and to only retain a control, low, medium, and high N treatment.


#### iii) After we have discussed as a class, write out and run the workflow in tidyverse R.
Here's the data import to get you going:
```{r}
# load the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# create a function to calculate standard error
calcSE<-function(x){
  x <- x[is.na(x)==F]
  sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))
}

# read in the data 
cdrplant <- read.csv("e001_Plant aboveground biomass data.csv", stringsAsFactors = F, skip = 726) %>%
  as_tibble()

cdrrich <- cdrplant %>%
  
  # remove entries with no biomass
  filter(!is.na(Biomass), Biomass > 0) %>%
  
  # remove entries that are not species option 1, this is one way that is faster with many species
  filter(!Species %in% c("Miscelaneous Woody", "Miscelanious herb", "Pine cones", "Mosses & lichens 2", "Miscellaneous forb", "Miscellaneous sedges", "Miscellaneous woody plants", "Miscellaneous grasses 2", "Miscellaneous legumes", "Forb seedlings", "Miscellaneous rushes", "Fungi", "Miscellaneous grasses", "Miscellaneous sp.", "Miscellaneous herbs", "Miscellaneous litter")) %>%
  
  # remove entries that are not species option 2, this is the way we learned, but it is tedious with many species...
  # here just removing two entries as a demo
  filter(Species != "Miscellaneous litter",
         Species != "Miscellaneous herbs") %>%
  
  # select only unique species (ie, remove duplicate entries) 
  select(-Biomass) %>%
  unique() %>%
  
  # calculate richness within year, field, plot and treatment
  group_by(Year, Field, Plot, NTrt) %>%
  summarize(rich=n()) %>%
  
  # calculate mean richness and se richness within year and treatment
  group_by(Year,NTrt) %>%
  summarize(avg_rich = mean(rich), se_rich = calcSE(rich)) %>%

  # select only the years and treatments that Clark and Tilman 2008 used
  # choosing to use just the first control treatment here (1 and not 9)
  # Not that you can use the %in% syntax such that: NTrt %in% c(1,2,3,5)
  filter(Year < 2005,
         NTrt == 1 | NTrt == 2 | NTrt == 3 | NTrt == 5) 
  

ggplot(cdrrich, aes(x=Year,y=avg_rich,color=as.factor(NTrt)))+geom_point() + geom_line() + geom_errorbar(aes(x=Year,ymin=avg_rich-se_rich,ymax=avg_rich+se_rich))

```
